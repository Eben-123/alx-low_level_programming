0x07-pointers,arrays and strings
A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection, or a chain of pointers. Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. 

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'.

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain how to;
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
Write a function that copies memory area.
Write a function that locates a character in a string.
Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
Write a function that locates a substring.
Write a function that prints the chessboard.
Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
